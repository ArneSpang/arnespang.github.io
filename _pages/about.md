I am a geoscientist with a strong focus on computational thermomechanics. With my models, I attempt to link subsurface processes like magma migration or thermal softening to surface observables such as ground deformation or seismic waves. My models cover magmatic systems, deep earthquakes, and the dynamics of the lithosphere in general. I develop code which consideres rhealistic compsoite rheologies and can capture the nonlinear interactions between temperature, stress, and strain rate. My work includes:
- Development of high-performance GPU code in Julia and CPU code in C
- Optimizing numerical solutions to nonlinear problems
- Running geodynamic models
- Processing and analyzing results in Julia, Python, and Matlab
- Testing parameter sensitvity and deriving scaling laws from a large suite of models
- Inverting geophysical observations such as seismic imaging, gravity, and ground deformation to constrain subsurface processes and material parameters
- Investigating the mechanical viability of theorized processes

I am still building this page. There will be more content soon. One day, I promise...
