permalink: /publication/2022-05-20-Volatiles
excerpt: '* Exsolving volatiles accumulate at the roof of a magma storage zone and contribute to surface deformation through buoyancy forces \n
* 3D numerical models show that surface deformation is a function of the volatiles' volume, density and depth as well as crustal rigidity \n
* Volatile release during eruption can cause syn-eruptive subsidence of a few cm, which is 20% of the observed signal at Calbuco in 2015'
