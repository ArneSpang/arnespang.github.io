excerpt: 'In this work, we use a joint interpretation of seismic imaging, magnetotellurics, gravity anomalies, and petrolgocial constraints to create a 3D model of the Altiplano-Puna magma system. We then use this model as an input geometry for a thermomechanical model which computes surface deformation due to subsurface magma transport and compare it to constraints from InSAR groudn deformation. This combination of observational constraints allows us to invert for the location, size, geometry, and properties of the Altiplano-Puna magma body (APMB). With the help of Bayesian inference, we constrain the average melt content of the APMB to be between 15 and 22 w%.'
