* DEDLoc is a 1D and 2D thermomechanical code to investigate rapid ductile strain localization by thermal runaway
* Rapid strain localization poses several challanges: (i) spontaneous initiation; (ii) poor nonlinear solver convergence; and (iii) mesh-dependent results 
* Strategies to overcome theses challenges: (i) adaptive time stepping; (ii) adaptive rescaling; (iii) viscosity regularization; and (iv) gradient regularization
* The latent heat of melting or phase transformations is not sufficient to regularize localizatin by thermal runaway
