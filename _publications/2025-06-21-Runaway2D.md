* 2D thermomechanical, visco‐elastic models resolve nucleation and propagation of transient  uctile ruptures driven by thermal runaway
* Ductile ruptures can reach seismic velocities for mantle transition zone conditions, in line with deep‐focus earthquake locations
* Ductile creep events near the brittleductile transition can cause pressure perturbations sufficient to induce brittle earthquakes
