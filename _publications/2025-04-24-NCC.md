* 2D thermo-mechanical modeling to investigate the destruction of the eastern North China Craton
* Craton destruction within 20 - 40 Myr requires a density exceeding the underlying mantle and viscosity below 10^22^ Pa s
* A flat slab may have hydrated the eastern part of the North China Craton, weakening it and promoting thinning and destruction
* Rapid weakening likely resulted from accelerated hydration, aided by extensive magmatism that enhanced fluid pathways
* Presence of only a high density lower crust or weak mid-lithospheric discontinuity does not cause craton destruction
