* Numerical investigation of thermal runaway in visco‐elastic material with diffusion creep, dislocation creep and low‐temperature plasticity
* Nondimensional scaling analysis reveals two dimensionless groups governing the occurrence of thermal runaway
* Ductile localization can cause slip events in line with deep earthquakes and pseudotachylyte formation at subducting slab core conditions
